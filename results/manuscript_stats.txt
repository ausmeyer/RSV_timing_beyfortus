SEASON DEFINITION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  • RSV season defined as July 1 through June 30 of the following year
  • This definition captures early summer activity that may precede
    the traditional fall-winter season
  • 2023-24 season: July 1, 2023 – June 30, 2024
  • 2024-25 season: July 1, 2024 – June 30, 2025

WINDOW DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed Windows:
  • Baseline (Oct-Mar): October 1 – March 31
    Corresponds to current CDC nirsevimab guidance for continental US
  • Early (Sep-Mar): September 1 – March 31
    One-month earlier start to capture early-season activity
  • Extended (Sep-Apr): September 1 – April 30
    Earlier start plus one-month later end

Dynamic (State-Specific Onset-Offset) Window:
  • Onset and offset detected separately for each state and season
  • Onset definition: First week of sustained RSV activity increase
  • Offset definition: First week after peak when activity returns to baseline
  • See detailed algorithm description below

ONSET DETECTION ALGORITHM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The onset detection algorithm identifies the beginning of the RSV season
using a growth-rate approach that is sensitive to early epidemic signals:

1. Data Preparation:
   • Weekly RSV values are smoothed using a 3-week rolling average
   • Baseline is computed as the median of the first 4 weeks of the season
     (July values, representing pre-season activity)

2. Growth Rate Calculation:
   • Week-over-week growth rate computed as: value(week t) / value(week t-1)

3. Onset Criteria (Primary):
   • Onset = first week where BOTH conditions are met for 2 consecutive weeks:
     a) Growth rate >10% (i.e., ratio >1.10)
     b) Smoothed value exceeds minimum threshold (0.08% for NSSP)

4. Onset Criteria (Secondary):
   • If primary criteria not met, onset = first week where:
     a) Smoothed value exceeds baseline + 1 SD OR 30% above baseline
     b) Any positive growth (ratio ≥1.0) for 2 consecutive weeks

OFFSET DETECTION ALGORITHM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The offset detection algorithm identifies when the RSV season has ended
using a conservative return-to-baseline approach:

1. Peak Identification:
   • Peak week = week with maximum smoothed RSV value after detected onset

2. Baseline Threshold:
   • Return-to-baseline threshold = MAX of:
     a) Baseline median + 3 standard deviations
     b) 3× baseline median
     c) Minimum value (0.15% for NSSP)
   • This conservative threshold ensures the season is truly over

3. Offset Criteria:
   • Offset = first week AFTER the peak where smoothed value remains
     at or below the baseline threshold for 2 consecutive weeks

BURDEN AND COVERAGE CALCULATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
  For each state and season, we computed the fraction of total RSV activity
  that occurred outside the October 1 – March 31 window. This 'out-of-window
  fraction' represents the proportion of RSV burden that would NOT be covered
  by nirsevimab administered during the recommended window.

Step-by-Step Calculation:

  1. For each state-season, sum the weekly RSV metric across all weeks:
     Total burden = Σ (weekly RSV value) for weeks in Jul 1 – Jun 30

  2. Sum the weekly RSV metric for weeks WITHIN the Oct–Mar window:
     In-window burden = Σ (weekly RSV value) for weeks in Oct 1 – Mar 31

  3. Compute out-of-window burden by subtraction:
     Out-of-window burden = Total burden − In-window burden

  4. Compute the out-of-window fraction:
     Out-of-window fraction = Out-of-window burden / Total burden

  5. Coverage is the complement:
     Coverage = 1 − Out-of-window fraction = In-window burden / Total burden

Interpretation by Data Source:

  NSSP (ED visit percentage):
    • Weekly values are percentages (e.g., 1.5% of ED visits were RSV-related)
    • 'Burden' = sum of weekly percentages across the season
    • Example: If total season burden = 15.0 (sum of weekly %s) and
      in-window burden = 14.0, then out-of-window fraction = 1.0/15.0 = 6.7%
    • This represents the fraction of RSV-related ED visit activity outside window

  NHSN (hospital admission counts):
    • Weekly values are counts (e.g., 150 RSV admissions that week)
    • 'Burden' = sum of weekly admission counts across the season
    • Example: If total season admissions = 2,000 and in-window = 1,900,
      then out-of-window fraction = 100/2,000 = 5.0%
    • This represents the fraction of RSV hospitalizations outside window

Alternative Window Evaluation:
  The same calculation was repeated for alternative window definitions:
    • Early (Sep–Mar): In-window = Sep 1 – Mar 31
    • Extended (Sep–Apr): In-window = Sep 1 – Apr 30
    • Dynamic: In-window = state-specific onset week to offset week

RESULTS PARAGRAPH 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Across states, a median of 5.8% (IQR: 4.7–8.5%) of RSV-associated ED visits (NSSP) occurred outside the October–March window in 2023-24, and 7.3% (IQR: 6.1–9.6%) in 2024-25. For RSV-associated hospitalizations (NHSN, 2024-25), the median was 5.2% (IQR: 4.4–7.7%).

DISCUSSION PARAGRAPH 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Approximately 6% of RSV activity nationally—and up to 18% in some states—occurs outside the current recommended nirsevimab administration window.
