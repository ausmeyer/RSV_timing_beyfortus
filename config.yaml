# Primary outcome field

# Fixed prophylaxis window (per season year Y: Oct 1 Y to Mar 31 Y+1)
# This aligns with CDC's Oct 1 through Mar 31 guidance for continental US

  start_day: 1
  end_month: 3
  end_day: 31

# Analysis parameters
analysis:
  smoothing_window: 3                    # weeks for moving average
  material_activity_threshold: 0.20      # fraction of peak (primary)
  material_activity_sensitivity: 0.10    # fraction of peak (sensitivity analysis)

# Trigger-based onset detection (threshold method)
trigger:
  method: "threshold"
  consecutive_weeks: 2                   # sustained weeks above threshold
  lead_weeks: 2                          # start window this many weeks before onset
  window_duration_weeks: 24              # ~5.5 months protection (matches Beyfortus efficacy)
